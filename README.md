# Vinyl

A community for record enthusiasts to review their favorite albums.

Part of the application has already been built for you. Your job is to take it to completion.

## Getting Started

The app uses a simple file structure for an Express web app server that renders views using EJS templates.

```sh
public/               # static assets
src/
  actions/            # async server actions (e.g. data CRUD)
  data/               # db schema & seed data
  db/                 # database client & utils
  routes/             # express routes
  views/              # html templates
```

### Setting Up Your Database

Use the following commands to set up and seed your database:

1. Create PostgreSQL database `vinyl`: `$ npm run db:create`
1. Set up database tables from `schema.sql`: `$ npm run db:schema`
1. Load seed data from `albums.sql`: `$ npm run db:seed`
